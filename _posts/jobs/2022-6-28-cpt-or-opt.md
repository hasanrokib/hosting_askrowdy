                    <h2><strong>You are eligible to apply if you meet the following criteria: </strong></h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>You are currently in active F-1 status.</span></li>
                        <li><span>You have been enrolled in a full course of study for one academic year in the U.S. or
                                will complete one academic year by the date the OPT approval begins.</span></li>
                        <li><span>You have not exceeded 12 months of full-time Curricular Practical Training (CPT)
                                authorization. (Part-time CPT does not affect OPT eligibility.)</span></li>
                        <li><span>You do not need a job offer first; you can apply for the 12-month OPT authorization
                                without a job offer.</span></li>
                        <li><span>You have not previously completed 12 months of OPT at the same degree level.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>You are eligible for 12 months of full-time OPT per academic level. For example, you
                                may apply for 12 months of OPT after completing a bachelor's degree and then another 12
                                months after completing a master's degree. Extensions may be granted to students in STEM
                                fields. See the “STEM OPT Resources” link for more information.</span></li>
                        <li><span>You may apply for OPT authorization during your academic program, after your program
                                completion, or a combination of both.</span></li>
