        <p class="page_description"> Let’s face it. When it comes to part-time job opportunities, we know you have
            options in the Cape Girardeau area. However, working on campus can connect you with a large network of
            faculty, staff, and students who are interested in your academic success and will put your student needs
            before their work needs. You may even be able to find a part-time job within your area of study to gain
            professional experience. </p>
