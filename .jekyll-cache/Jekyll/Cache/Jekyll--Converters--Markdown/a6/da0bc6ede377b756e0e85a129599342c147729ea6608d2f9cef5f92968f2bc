I"Ä<p>Students from Non-Computer Science majors need to take one <em>or</em> both of the pre-requisite courses:</p>

<h2 id="cs500-fundamentals-of-programming">CS500: Fundamentals of Programming</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Algorithms &amp; Data Structures</li>
  <li>Object Oriented Programming</li>
  <li>Discrete Mathematics</li>
  <li>Standard libraries with an emphasis on practical programming</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cs503-fundamentals-of-computing">CS503: Fundamentals of Computing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Computer Organizaiton/Architecture</li>
  <li>Computer Networks</li>
  <li>Algorithms Design &amp; Analysis</li>
  <li>Operating Systems</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>CS500 and CS503 does not count towards your degree. You are <strong>required to</strong> compete them before you can start your regular (core/optional) courses.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="re-requisite-course-waiver">Re-Requisite Course Waiver</h2>
<p>Students can select any one option:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Complete a <strong>completion certificate</strong> for the re-requisite courses, which the student has taken in another regionally accredited university</li>
  <li>Show any evidence in form of a <strong>letter representing significant experience (3+ years)</strong> in programming and introductory Computer Science. This should indicate:
    <ul>
      <li>Data of service and Scope of work.</li>
      <li>Emphasize the studentâ€™s skills about CS500 and/or CS503 courses above</li>
      <li>Issued on organization standard letterhead by manager with verifiable contact information</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>digital artifact</strong> such as git repository, tools developed, website enhancements to prove your experience.</li>
  <li>Take the <strong>pre-requisite waiver exame</strong> in the Computer Science department about the programming and computing courses and receive a minimum â€˜Bâ€™ grade.</li>
</ul>
